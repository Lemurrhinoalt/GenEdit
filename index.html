      <p>
         Sickle-cell disease, is a group of diseases that makes blood cells deteriorate and contort them into sickle shapes. People impacted by this condition have suddon extreme pain, comparable to child birth. Other compications include anemia, increases suceptability to strokes, inceased suceptability to infections, and acute chest syndrome.

    <h2>What is CRISPR/CAS9?</h2>
      <p>CAS9 is part of bacteria used as a way to defend against bacteriophages, another really helpful tool, by checking its DNA. CRISPR is a implimentation of the CAS9 protien to edit DNA on other cells.
        <br>Think of CRISPR like the Airport baggage scanners. The bags are the DNA, and the scanner is CAS9. If something that gets passed through TSA that is harmful, they then keep that in mind and look out for such items. CAS9 works much the same, when the cell gets infected, CAS9 stores a sample of the infection's genetic material, so if it runs across the same infection, CAS9 can find and remove the material.
